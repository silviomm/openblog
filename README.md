# openblog
<hr>
A project created with Meteor so I can learn this JS framework.

## Idea
<hr>
Each "Tag" would be the name of a blog and generates a URL that ends with the name of it. That URL contains an open-blog.
Open-blog can be interpreted as a "dontpad of blogs", where anyone can post/delete any content in there(that is exclusive to that tag).

## Planned Objectives
<hr>
- ~~Dynamic URL with tag name;~~
- Materialize.css framework as design;
- Integration Meteor-Cordova;
- Change blaze for Angular(probably distant future);

## Preview
<hr>
Preview hosted on Meteor server.
